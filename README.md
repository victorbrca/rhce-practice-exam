# rhce-practice-exam

This repo/site contains practice exams, as well as information for the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certification.

It serves as a community study resource for the RHCE exam. The idea is that anyone preparing for the exam can use the information here, as well as contribute (add, update, correct) to make it better. The aim is to have free and open source study content that is always up to date.

The content exists in two different places, the website (front end) https://rhce-practice-exam.org, and the repo (source files) https://github.com/victorbrca/rhce-practice-exam. The website only shows markdown files converted to html. To download the files used in the practice exams, and the answer files, visit the GitHub project page - [GitHub - victorbrca/rhce-practice-exam: A repo containing practice exams for RHCE.](https://github.com/victorbrca/rhce-practice-exam).
